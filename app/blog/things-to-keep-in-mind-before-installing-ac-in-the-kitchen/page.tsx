      <P text="The kitchen is the throbbing heart in any Household especially the bustling of the pots and pans, the sizzle of tempering spices, and the shine of the very familiar cutlery. It goes without saying; that the kitchen is the backbone of a household and a running commercial culinary setup. The gastronomy, culinary pattern, and nutrition, everything perhaps harps on the strings of comfort and functionality across the kitchen space. The skyrocketing temperature and surging dust suspended in the air, are compelling us to consider the installation of an AC inside the kitchen for an elevated and comfortable cooking experience. Now here are some imperative deliberations around the installation of AC in the kitchen." />
      <ListOptions options={[
        "Size and capacity for effective cooling: Kitchen spaces are usually not spread over a large quarter hence are compact. Calculating the layout of the kitchen by accurate square footage is necessary. For the cooling unit to be strategically placed you might consider contacting an HVAC professional or consulting with the concerned authority to be aware of the British Thermal Unit ( BTU). For effective cooling of the entire space by the kitchen AC, you must first have a word with the electrical technician and lineman; to get to know if is it safe to install AC in the kitchen at all! ",
        "Ventilation and Heat load for small AC for the kitchen: Greasy and spicy Indian recipes do require proper ventilation to expel the heat, odor, and smoke. Wherein exhaust fans have become commonplace in simple domestic kitchen setups as well as commercial setups, chimneys still are less prevalent across many kitchens. So, can we install an AC in the kitchen without having the ventilation matrix complementing it? The answer is No! Let's say, the fume and grease produced by the aromatic cooking does not go hand in hand with the positioning of the AC unit. AC in the kitchen must not be placed/installed anywhere around/above the kitchen top or oven or cooking and heating appliances.",
        "Heat Load balancing: Indian kitchens are often equipped with high-powered ovens, stoves, grills, microwave ovens, induction heaters, and so forth. The heat load produced by these appliances again brings the lineman back to the scene. The electrical technician has to strike a balance between the intensity of the cooking load/heat and the AC cooling unit capacity for effective cooling of the kitchen space. In fact, for consistent air temperature regulation, you must consider placing heavy load kitchen apparatus strategically positioned across the wiring outline and kitchen sphere layout.",
        "Choosing the Best AC for Kitchen: An array of options in the market for both commercial and domestic kitchen ACs has left us wondering whether it’s the split AC or the window ACs to purchase for efficient cooling. Well, boiling down to basics, one ought to opt for the split-type ACs with powerful compressors built in. What it offers is a multi-directional air flow to circulate the cool air throughout the kitchen area. Running your eyes at least once across the Energy Star rating of the AC is highly recommended. However, a moderate and consistent temperature of 26-28 degrees Celsius must be maintained inside the kitchen space for an optimal-paced cooking process avoiding the hassle of reheating items after they’ve cooled down fast.",
        "Humidity Control: fluctuating humidity levels across the Indian Sub-continent, especially across Bengal are posing a threat to air conditioning systems in kitchens. It not only accelerates the discomfort but also allows the growth of mold and mildew on the AC surfaces and along the ducts and vents of the machine. One must consider ACs with dehumidification features to aid in alleviating and tackling excess moisture in the kitchen. This supports hygiene across the space.",
        "Associated appliances: An efficient chimney suction would keep suffocation at bay. Replacing an open deep fryer and a brazier with a closed-lid air fryer would not be a bad consideration either. Well, both for the AC and for your health! Open roasters could be replaced with flat-top grills and oil-less steamers to reduce grease and smoke emissions. This would help the AC to perform at its best and regulate the air temperature across the kitchen. ",

      <ListOptions options={[
        "A centralized AC grid is often lucrative and convenient for larger spaces but for a small kitchen space it is a complete ‘ No-No ‘! Reusing the Re-circulated air would increase the musky grease and smoke load across the kitchen.",
        "Switching to induction-based cooktops might help since they release less heat compared to LPG stoves.",
        "Placing the AC machine anywhere above or near the cooking burners or the cooktop would be a bad idea. The AC in the kitchen must be placed on the opposite wall of the oven slab.",
        "Placing the fridge and freezer outside the kitchen would be a good idea since the heat release from another appliance would be lessened a little."
      ]}/>
      <P text="Well, excess heat build-up inside the kitchen could be done away with installing hoods. The unique culinary factors and diverse cooking styles especially in Indian kitchens have made it almost imperative to approach a tailor-made interior structuring to determine  ‘can we use AC in kitchen’. Observing traditional Indian cooking closely enough, makes us realize that the prolonged cooking time, usage of multiple burners, open flame cooking, open flame charring, and grilling pave the way for a significant heat build-up."/>

      <P text="Elevating the portable AC for the kitchen and remodeling both household and commercial kitchen AC units is the wittiest and most viable decision to make. To enhance one’s experience within the walls of the kitchen which often turns into a scorching and parching furnace; installing ACs inside the kitchen is a feasible idea for smoother accessibility around cooking. ‘ Can we install AC in the kitchen ?’ would not be a worrisome debate anymore if these points were taken into keen consideration."/>
