      <P text="Office spaces are leaning more toward minimalistic design approaches. A Boss office cabin design must take under consideration rather carefully consideration that it must cater to functionality while harping on the strings of a professional sense of aesthetics. Boss cabins should be anything but loud and gaudy. It should rather be sauve and modest and forthright perhaps. A functional working space that too for the one who would supervise others’ work decorum and productive deliverables has to be well thought-out in terms of layout and decor. Let us take a detailed walkthrough of such office space designs so that we are aware of the balance that one must strike for designing an executive deskspace. " />
      <SubHeading text="Space Utilization and layout for small office boss cabin design:"/>
      <P text="Opting for an open layout so that the area looks clutter-free and congestion-free would be a witty idea. However, areas are to be defined for an array of compartmentalized purposes such as file storage, record keeping, drawers, desktops, paperwork slots, installation of desktops along with a compact wiring grid, etc. Sometimes a shortage of carpet areas does not allow us to extend the workspace for client meetups, employee meetings, round table conferences, brainstorming sessions, and so on. A simple glass paneling to designate specific spaces to carry out particular tasks should be good enough for making the smaller cubicles sound-proof too. " />
      <P text="Using the walls for multi-layered storage/cupboards is the right way to go when the carpet area game is not strong enough. Investing in good quality foldable furniture is highly recommended especially for retaining a contemporary look with efficient space utilization methods."/>
      <SubHeading text="High-quality executive desk as the centerpiece:"/>
      <P text=" A Boss cabin design must be sturdy with a durable heavy build and a professional finish. If not spacious enough, it should at least have space for stationery, documents, and a worktop ( desktop/laptop). A built-in storage facility would work wonders across the executive worktop. The surface has to be smooth enough and aligned following the standard height of men and women across a region/ country. Maximizing functionality and style within limited resources and space is the new challenge to crack. "/>
      <P text="Trimming off complicated designs for a sleeker look is the real deal. But staying relevant and at par with the ever-changing trends in decor is a tough nut to crack. Well, working around wood or wood finish has never gone wrong in the history of the boss cabin interior. A tinge of warm light across window panels and couches along with warm to neutral white light for the central desk should be the ideal way for laying out the lighting matrix. " />
      <SubHeading text="Scientific and comfortable seating arrangements for employees and clients:"/>

      <ListOptions options={[
        "Well, haven’t we all seen Yoga instructors all over the globe filling their pockets in exchange for correcting all our postures? The prolonged work schedules stretching over 9-10 hours a day are physically taxing especially for our spines and necks and pelvic floors. But Ergonomic chairs have become the saviors to pull us out of this distraught. Yes, one might say these chairs are making our wallets go thinner but ergonomic chairs are worth investing in. ",
        "People might be cognitively most active while jumping, walking, hopping around, or maybe while taking a stroll. But seating is what enhances real productivity by inducing a certain stability and calm in posture and gesture. Comfortable plush seating is a dire need in this case. If one is sitting comfortably enough, his/her mind is at peace with professional deliverables, attainable deadlines, office communication, and curating creative ideas. Investing in good quality seats, chairs, cushions, and sofas is the road to take perhaps.",
        "Optimally opulent armchairs for a luxurious client corner could go hand in hand with comfortable small sofas for informal meetings. This could be complemented well by colorful beanbags for the creative corners and brainstorming sessions with the boss, especially in the media and creative industry. ",

      <SubHeading text="Investing in luxurious materials for Boss cabin interior design:"/>
      <P text="One has to be insightful and think long-term. Hence, investing in hardwood, premium marble countertops, etc is highly advisable. Good quality foam leather, waterproof sofa cover fabrics, in fact, leather upholstery, brass accents, or crystal lightings are solid investments. After all, functionality cannot be devoid of a tinge of glow and elegance. A prototype has to be fleshed out to check the durability of the raw material, to test its sustainability, and whether it is eco-friendly or not. The safety of design for engineering and production is of primal importance."/>
      <SubHeading text="Task lighting for dedicated work areas around the boss cabin table design:"/>
      <P text="Adjustable blinds, foldable curtains, natural light entry pathways, and glass panels are mostly worked around in modern and contemporary workspaces. However adequate and focused dimmer and illuminator are required for overhead lighting panels across desks."/>
      <SubHeading text="Privacy and soundproofing are of pivotal importance while designing Boss cabins:"/>
      <P text="Board of directors, Trustees of an organization, High priority clients mostly are involved in highly confidential meetings across business deals, budgets, financial protocols, company policies, and so on. Here is where soundproofing methods of interior designing come into play and are the key to retaining privacy in and around particular office spaces. Cabins and cubicles are mostly meant for focused ideation and implementation hence, smaller office spaces warrant more privacy around focalized conversation. "/>
      <SubHeading text="Incorporation of Greenery: "/>
      <P text="Low-maintenance indoor plants that survive and thrive with little to no maintenance could be planted and placed strategically so that they add a tinge of freshness and greenery. Well, traditionally there has been a saying that green is good for the eyes and soul, especially cutting down the adverse effects of digital blue ray!"/>
      <P text = "Some additional ideas such as adding good speakers and a sound system to the space could elevate the experience as a whole. Discreet speakers are used these days for noise cancellation, background music, or maybe for a more ambient noise environment in and around the office space. " />
